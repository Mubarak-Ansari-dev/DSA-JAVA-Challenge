// Sorting Algorithms- Arranging intems in increasing or decreasing order
   // example- 2,8,3,5,6,4,1,7
   // sorted- 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 - this is called Sorting (either increasing or decreasing order)
// And for this there are many approaches like- 

/*

 * 2. Selection Sort

 * 4. Merge Sort
 * 5. Quick Sort   
 * 6. Heap Sort
